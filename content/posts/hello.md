After messing with GitHub Pages, Hugo, and Jekyll for a while, I think I've finally decided on a workflow for blogging.

I'm using Hugo, and the GitHub repository for this site holds the Hugo project directory. GitHub looks in the /docs folder for the static website files to serve when you visit this domain. 

I have a local copy of the repository, where I make changes to website source files (like markdown files, etc.), and I use Hugo to rebuild the site into /docs when I'm done editing something. Then I just push the change.

This post is mostly just to test it out and have something instead of nothing.

Maybe I'll write a post detailing how to set this up and covering what I've learned of Hugo and GitHub Pages.
